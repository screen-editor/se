Installation Instructions

The project uses GNU autoconf and GNU automake to generate
scripts which will configure the build system. If there is
not a 'configure' script present, run these commands to
generate one based on the settings in configure.ac:

	$ make -f Makefile.am reconf

You can use the configure script to configure the build.
Run `./configure --help` for a complete list of options.
Then run `make` to build the software and `make install`
to install it. Here's a summary of the commands:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install
