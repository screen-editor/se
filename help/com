        When  the "cmd>" prompt appears near the bottom of the screen,
        a command may be typed.  Commands work for the most  part  the
        same way as commands to 'ed', the Unix system text editor with
        which you may be familiar.

          To return to the general help directory, type "hdir".          
          For information about specific commands, type "hcomdir".       
          For details on command syntax, type "hcomsyn".
