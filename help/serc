        serc -- $HOME/.serc -- Se Initialization File
        
        The file $HOME/.serc, if it exists, is read when se starts up.
        If a line begins with a '#', it is treated as a comment and is
        ignored.  It is useful for  setting  personal options  without
        the user having to type them in  on the command line  or use a
        special shell file or alias. Here is a sample .serc file:

            # turn on unix mode, tabs every 8 columns, auto indent
            opu
            ot+8
            oia

	Command line options ALWAYS override any options set by commands
	in the .serc file.
