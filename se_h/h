          h    -- Help command

               default range           syntax
                         n/a           h[ null | parameter]

        Typing  "h"  followed  by any character  string simply displays
        the  contents of the se help script of that name at the top  of
        the  screen  (provided  the  script  exists).  The  scripts are
        files in the directory '/usr/local/lib/se_h'. If the scriptname
        is omitted, "elp" is assumed.

        To see a general directory of help scripts, type "hdir".
