        l -- Locate command

             default range         syntax
                none                  l

        The  Locate  command  places the system name into the status
        line (e.g.  "gatech" or "gitpyr").    This is  so  that  you
        can tell  what  machine you are using from within the screen
        editor.  This is particularly useful for installations  with
        many  machines  that  can run the editor, where you are able
        to  switch back and forth between them, and become  confused
        as to where you are at a given moment.

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
