        olm -- Option Line Margin

        default range                           syntax
           1,$                                   olm[<col>]
        
        Sets the left margin to <col>  which must be a positive integer.
        This shifts the entire screen to  the left; the characters  that
        were in columns 1  through <col> - 1  will  not be visible.  You
        may continue editing in the normal fashion. To reset your screen
        to normal, enter the command "olm 1".  If <col> is omitted,  the
        current left margin column is displayed in the status line.

        For general information about the options command, type "ho".
