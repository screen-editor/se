        ! --- shell escape

        default range                            syntax
                1,$                      ![<Unix command>]

        The user's choice of shell is taken from the $SHELL environment vari-
        able and used to execute <Unix command> if it is present.  Otherwise,
        an  interactive shell is created. A leading ! is replaced by the pre-
        vious  shell  command.  Thus !!  executes  the previous  command.  An
        unescaped  % is replaced  by  the saved  file name. An expanded shell
        command is echoed  before it is  executed. After an interactive shell
        exits, the screen is immediately  redrawn. If a  command was run, the
        results are left on the  screen,  and the user must  type a return to
        redraw the editing window.

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir".
