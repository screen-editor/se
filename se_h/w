          w    -- Write command

               default range                syntax
                         1,$        w[! | + | >] [file name]

        "w"  writes  the  buffer  to a file.  If issued without a file
        name the current file name is used.  If "f" was used to change
        the file name or if a file name was given, a new file will  be
        created and written unless the file already exits which causes
        a  warning.   The warning may be bypassed using "w!".  Options
        [+] or [>] mean to append to the file instead of writing  over
        it. Se expands environment variables occuring in file names.

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
        See also:   "hf", "hok".
